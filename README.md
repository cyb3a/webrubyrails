## Web Ruby Rails
A first encounter with Ruby on Rails, programmed in April 2018 by Tabea Glindemann for a class on web development by V. Schmidt at HTW Berlin.

##Getting started
Installing the app is pretty easy!

###Prerequisites
* Ruby version 2.4.1
* Rails Rails 5.2.0
* npm web server

###Installing
You have obviously downloaded the webrubyrails app! Great!
Start the server running by typing `bin/rails server` in  > this < folder. You can then simply access the webapp on `localhost:3000`

###System dependencies
Will definitely work on Ubuntu 17.10 using Mozilla Firefox. Other operating systems and browsers need to still be tested. Please get back to the developer in case things work - or don't.

###Configuration
The app will take care of (almost) everything for you. By accessing the frontpage you will automatically be led to a Greek version of `hello world`. If you access `localhost:3000/goodbye`, the `bye`-method will be excecuted on a different page where you can take leave.

##Contact
If you have any feedback or questions, do not hesitate to get back to me via `s0553838@htw-berlin.de`!
